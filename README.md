An interactive [dashboard](https://alydavis.github.io/index.html) exploring Belly Button Biodiversity data.

## About the Project
The human body is home to many different types of bacteria. A single belly button can be home to 20-100 different species. With so much complex data, what is the best way to visualize the types of bacteria in the body? This project utilizes a sample data set from belly button bacteria. (Data source: ) Data is parsed and transformed with JavaScript, and an interactive HTML dashboard displays the results. Participants can view their species based on sample ID (as the data is anonymized).
